It was published on May 26, 2016. The paper discusses the study of graphs on lattice points with edges coming from a finite set of allowed moves. The authors show that the diameter of these graphs can be bounded from above by a constant. They also analyze the mixing behavior of heat-bath random walks on these graphs and provide conditions for the heat-bath random walk to be an expander in fixed dimension.\n",
